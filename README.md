# portfolio-website
These are the files for a django portfolio website.  It lets you add projects in the admin panel to auto populate on the page.

I am currently working on learning how to deploy it in AWS elastic beanstalk.


To use these files you may:
 - In your console command line, install the packages from the requirements.txt file. (-r requirements.txt)
 - Add a file called .env and add a unique autogenerated key.  Place this file on the same level as the requirements.txt file.
 - A SQLite3 database and manage.py should be created when you create your django project.
 - In your console command line, collect all static files for production, dev static files are in static-dev. (python manage.py collectstatic)
 - Be sure to update the logo and information displayed to your own.
